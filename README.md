## Example

### Case Study
[Here](https://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~sina.keshvadi1/movie/case.html) is the output of a case study of video streaming from YouTube and Facebook.

### log
To test the MoVIE's ability, captured data from YouTube video streaming is [here](https://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~sina.keshvadi1/movie/example).
